# Getting Started

Let's discover how to start with the fullstack cloud project

Get started by creating the **cloud**.

## What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14 or above:

## Generate the cloud

Generate the cloud site using the [create home cloud](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-home-cloud) tool.

You can simply start by running the next command:


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm init home-cloud@latest
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn create home-cloud
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run the cloud.

## Start your site

Run the server:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
cd server
npm start:build
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
cd server
yarn start:build
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Cloud site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm start` or `yarn start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
